# Rotary-dial-numpad
Add a numpad to your C64 or VIC-20, based on a DIY rotary dial.
This project is complete nonsense... but it does work.

The rotary dial in this project is made using 3D-printing techniques.
It does not require you to destroy an old telephone in order to obtain the dial mechanism.
This project allows you to make everything yourself without the need of special parts like springs cogs and mechanical speed regulators. Just a simple RC-servo (electronics removed) and some microswitches.

The rest is software running onthe VIC-20 or C64, which constantly pulls the signals from the joystick port in order to count the pulses and process them. All running under interrupt.
